# 3D Skeleton-Based Sport Action Recognition System via Deep Learning
This project is about processing and analyzing video data using various machine learning techniques. It primarily focuses on extracting frames from video files, transforming these frames, and evaluating different convolutional neural network (CNN) models.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Preparation**
    - Loading video files and extracting frames.
    - Preprocessing the frames for analysis.
2. **Model Building**
    - Constructing CNN models with different architectures.
    - Using Keras and TensorFlow for model implementation.
3. **Model Training**
    - Training the CNN models on the preprocessed data.
    - Using techniques such as stratified k-fold cross-validation.
4. **Evaluation**
    - Evaluating the models' performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Generating confusion matrices and classification reports.
